## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a deceptively challenging project for me. Part of that reason was because of some mistakes I made at the very beginning. I didn't include links to the bootstrap libraries and in my faux confidence, I thought it wasn't my fault. So, I built everything using a card system that was tremendously wonky and didn't line up with anything that I had learned from my courses. When I finally figured out I wasn't even using the bootstrap libraries I realized cards were the wrong direction and basically had to start over again. It went by quickly once I got that working though. I struggled with the alignment of the three divs inside the grey rounded box. I wonder if this is because I tried using grids for alignment. Ultimately, I had to hard code some strange margins/paddings. Another thing I learned on this project was using the box-shadows. It was my first time actually using them. They aren't as straightforward to use so there was a lot of trial and error.



### Continued development

As for some places to improve, I see issues with some clipping in the rounded corners and the drop shadows that I wasn't able to address. I worked around it but wasn't sure where it was coming from. I would like to continue learning about more alignment techniques because I wasn't too happy with the grid system at least not in this application. Thanks!
